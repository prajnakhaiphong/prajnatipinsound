Prajna - Transcendental Inner Peace (TIP) - in Sound via "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>" is a "<b>topic</b>" for community connections and contributions to provide <b>Free Helps</b> and <b>Specialized Services</b> in widening and deepening the "<b>topic</b>". It maintains open-source tools <b>on the supply side</b> of any <b>Service</b> - riding on available <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> streaming and cryptographic platform - to enable interest parties connect to the "<b>topic</b>" for an action. The open-source tools <b>on the demand side</b> are maintained at its <a href="https://github.com/awakeningbudh/prajnatipinsound" target="_blank">AwakeningBudh</a> organisation.

Similar to <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personaai" target="_blank">PersonaAI</a>, the tools are parts of REST API to available <b>topics</b> whose data are stored in its private <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb" target="_blank">PersonaDB</a> for data processing and statements of TRUTH from community ledger. Via open-source of required tools <b>on the supply side</b>, we lower the barrier of entry for any beneficial <b>Service</b> in <b>Making Life Easier and Happier</b> while deepening and widening the ecosystem of <a href="https://github.com/awakeningbudh/" target="_blank">AwakeningBudh</a>. It is not easy to have a trait of quality living that you naturally have but taking for granted that many yearn for it but do not know "<b>How</b>" and "<b>Why</b>", leaving the "wild garden" for criminals and professional scam artists <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D19" target="_blank">not Knowing yet claimed to Know not Seeing yet claimed to See</a> in many 1000+ years of human sufferings.

We encounter a <b>#HappyCouple</b> in their natural relationship. In pointing out their special "<b>trait</b>" and asking them to reverse engineering the core qualities and required conditions to make the outcome happened as they actually know, the husband said it may be "<b>fate</b>". We say everything happened is the outcome of "<b>Dependent Nature</b>" of Action-Reaction and Likes-attract-Likes, and ask them to look at those having the Christian "<b>Sacrament of Holy Matrimony</b>" or Buddhist "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/a-light-out-of-darkness.html#Section_1.1" target="_blank">Ritual for Forever Harmony / Lễ Hằng Thuận</a>" via gate keepers of any religion to see if many can have their natural state. They must be doing it together in their past lives to have a "<b>déjà vu / already seen</b>", and it is worthy to make known this <b>cultivable Conscious Living</b>. Similarly <b>#HappyFamily</b>, <b>#Education</b>, etc, are worthy topics that many can contribute since it is the "<b>Inner Peace / Samadhi</b>" to naturally produce an "<b>outer order</b>" for higher Value of the values via education. The key is to "<b>Share</b>" a quality naturally evolved to change oneself and the environment toward <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R23" target="_blank">What Count</a>. A concrete and significant solution will naturally attract required resources to make it happened that we are hedging in the past 45+ years that we hope everyone can be a part to make the target sustainable for any serious <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/agent-of-changes.html" target="_blank">Agent of Changes</a> in exploring one's Raison D'être.

In "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">#PrajnaTIPinSound</a>", the "<b>Natural Purification</b>" of outside-in for <b>reborn and rejuvenation</b> is stronger and stronger as one moves toward <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-inner-peace.html#Section_3" target="_blank">Not-Self and Nirvana / Unmoving Sunyata</a> to personally verify at least three possibilities: (1) dissolve past karmic force that one is fully aware the force (binding Word/Image and/or clinging Thought - Sở Tri Chướng) is naturally and effortlessly dropped exactly as asserted by Gotama, (2) bring a "hidden worm" in one's deep layer of consciousness to surface for proper management and dissolving it, (3) powerful natural relaxation that one tends to further desire that aesthetic state if not properly instructed. It is very unbearable if one cannot handle the second case that is why the consciousness technologies will not be introduced until required help is there to handle the edge cases.

It is Not a "chicken-and-egg" if we sense a right time for required resources to (1) create minimum ICT (Information Communication Technology) infrastructure of <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a>, (2) train <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_5" target="_blank">qualified counselors</a> having background from different domains to handle possible edge cases while digging deeper the Consciousness Technologies in their specialised fields, (3) have the technology patented to prevent <b>global armies of criminals and professional scam artists in Buddhism</b> jumping on the bandwagon, <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#D19" target="_blank">claiming to know what they do not Know to see what they do not See</a> in 2500+ years of cheating humanity.

Each <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">KhaiPhong</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awakeningbudh/" target="_blank">AwakeningBudh</a> project works in concert with other projects, but is an "<b>independent unit</b>" to be responsive to its internal and external "<b>clients</b>" who are the resources for its sustainable existence. By specializing and going deep in the focussed area, you have at your (project) service <b>not only in-depth Technical Knowledge but also competitive Price and excellent Services</b>.
